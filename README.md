Deployment of Web Application using EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, EC2 Instance Connect without key pair and launching portfolio on an instance

ðŸ”¹ Project Description
This project demonstrates deployment of a web application on AWS using EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, and EC2 Instance Connect.
The main objective is to deploy a portfolio application in a secure, scalable, and reliable environment while following AWS best practices â€” with a key highlight on accessing EC2 without requiring a traditional key pair.

ðŸ”¹Features
Web Application Deployment on EC2 instance.
Static Asset Storage with S3.
Custom VPC for network isolation and enhanced security.
IAM Roles and Policies for fine-grained access control.
EC2 Instance Connect for accessing EC2 without a key pair.
Portfolio Application Deployment to showcase your work or profile.

ðŸ”¹Technologies Used
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) for application server
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for static files
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for network isolation
IAM (Identity and Access Management) for securing resources
EC2 Instance Connect for accessing EC2 without a key pair
Web Application (Portfolio) for demonstration

ðŸ”¹Workflow (Concept)
An EC2 instance is launched within a custom VPC for isolation.
An S3 bucket is configured to store static assets for the portfolio.
IAM roles and policies are set up to enable fine-grained access control.
EC2 Instance Connect is used to connect safely to EC2 without needing a key pair.
The portfolio application is deployed to EC2 and serves content alongside files from S3.
Security groups, routing tables, and other VPC components control network flow and restrict access.

ðŸ”¹Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete and realistic way to deploy a portfolio application in the AWS Cloud while following best practices for *network isolation, **access control, **scalability, and *secure connectivity â€” all without requiring a traditional EC2 key pair.
